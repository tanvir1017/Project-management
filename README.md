| Requirement ID | Description               | User Story                                                                                                   | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BR001          | User Authentication       | As a user, I want to securely log in and register so I can access my account and use the website.            | The system should provide an authentication mechanism (login/registration) using secure methods (e.g., JWT).                     |
| BR002          | Role-based Access Control | As an admin, I want to control user access to different areas of the website based on their roles.           | The system should assign roles (admin, user, guest) and provide access control based on those roles.                             |
| BR003          | URL List Management       | As a user, I want to manage my lists of URLs (add, edit, delete, etc.) through the backend API.              | The backend should support CRUD operations for user URL lists, including the ability to update or delete URLs.                   |
| BR004          | Custom URL Generation     | As a user, I want the backend to generate a custom URL for my list when requested.                           | The backend should check the availability of the custom URL and generate a unique one if none is provided.                       |
| BR005          | URL List Storage          | As a user, I want my list of URLs to be stored securely in the database so that it persists across sessions. | The system should store URLs in a structured database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL), ensuring persistence and security.            |
| BR006          | URL List Sharing          | As a user, I want to share my list with others using a link, which should be handled by the backend.         | The system should generate a unique, shareable link for each URL list, ensuring it is accessible to others.                      |
| BR007          | List Publishing           | As a user, I want to publish my list so others can view it.                                                  | The backend should include a status field for each list, and once marked as "published," the list should be accessible publicly. |
| BR008          | Data Validation           | As a user, I want to ensure that only valid URLs are added to my list, preventing errors or spam.            | The backend should validate URLs before adding them to the database, ensuring they conform to the proper format.                 |
| BR009          | List Deletion             | As a user, I want to delete a list entirely from the system if I no longer need it.                          | The system should allow users to delete their lists and all associated URLs from the database permanently.                       |
| BR010          | List Visibility           | As a user, I want my list to be either public or private based on my choice, controlled via the backend.     | The backend should provide the option to set visibility (public/private) for each list and ensure this setting is enforced.      |
| BR011          | Logging and Monitoring    | As an admin, I want to track and monitor user actions and errors to maintain system security.                | The backend should implement logging for critical actions (e.g., list creation, deletion) and error handling with monitoring.    |
| BR012          | API Rate Limiting         | As a user, I want to avoid abuse of the system, so my API usage is limited to reasonable requests.           | The system should implement rate limiting to control the number of requests per user/IP to avoid spamming.                       |
| BR013          | User Feedback Integration | As a user, I want to submit feedback or report bugs via the system to improve the service.                   | The backend should provide an API endpoint for submitting user feedback and handling issues like bugs or complaints.             |

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability:**
  - The backend should be able to scale as the user base grows.
- **Security:**
  - All sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment details) should be securely stored.
- **Performance:**
  - Fast response times for user interactions and payment processing.

## Timeline

- **Completion Date:** [Insert project deadline, e.g., 15 days from start]
- **Milestones:**
  - **Phase 1:** User authentication setup and basic API endpoints
  - **Phase 2:** Booking system and payment integration
  - **Phase 3:** Admin dashboard and final review

## Deployment Requirements

- The backend will be hosted on [Hosting provider, e.g., Heroku, AWS].
- Database management should be done via [MongoDB Atlas/PostgreSQL].
- Deployment scripts should be provided for easy deployment to the live environment.

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests should be written for the API endpoints.
- Test payment gateway integration in a sandbox environment.
- Perform load testing to ensure the system can handle traffic.

## Client Communication

- Regular updates should be provided to the client, especially when reaching major milestones or encountering issues.
- Any additional requirements or changes should be clarified as soon as possible.

## Notes

- The project must replicate the key functionality seen in the reference websites provided by the client.
- The website must support both desktop and mobile views.
